# RNOW San Joaquin County Warehouse Map - Prototype

## Introduction

The [Riverside Neighbors Opposing Warehouses (RNOW)](https://sites.google.com/view/rivnow/) Map of Warehouses in San Joaquin County is a publicly available tool developed to help visualize the development of warehouses. This dashboard is largely based off of the [Warehouse CITY](https://radicalresearch.shinyapps.io/WarehouseCITY/) tool developed in collaboration by [Redford Conservancy at Pitzer College](https://www.pitzer.edu/redfordconservancy/) and [Radical Research LLC](http://radicalresearch.llc). That tool allows additional quantification capabilities. The RNOW community group opposes new warehouse development around the Orangecrest and Mission Grove neighborhoods of the City of Riverside. 

## Land-use (more like warehouse) Authorities

Multiple land-use authorities contribute to the warehouses in the San Joaquin County. They include the cities of Stockton, Tracy, Manteca, Ripon, Lathrop, and San Joaquin County.  

## Map and Data Provenance

The map can be navigated using point, click, and drag features or by clicking on the zoom plus and minus buttons on the top left corner of the map. At the top right of the map, the imagery can be switched between a street level **Basemap** and satellite **Imagery**. 

-   **Existing warehouses**: Data processed using methodology established in Warehouse City tool v1.09. Raw data from [San Joaquin County GIS data](https://sjmap.org/GISDataDownload.htm).
