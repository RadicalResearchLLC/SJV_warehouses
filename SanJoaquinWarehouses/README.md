# Warehouse Central - v1.01

## Introduction

The Warehouse CENTRAL map of Warehouses in San Joaquin County is a publicly available tool developed to help visualize the development of warehouses in the Central Valley of California. This dashboard is largely based off of the [Warehouse CITY](https://radicalresearch.shinyapps.io/WarehouseCITY/) tool developed in collaboration by [Redford Conservancy at Pitzer College](https://www.pitzer.edu/redfordconservancy/), Riverside Neighbors Opposing Warehouses(https://sites.google.com/view/rivnow/) and [Radical Research LLC](http://radicalresearch.llc). That tool allows additional quantification capabilities. 

## Land-use (more like warehouse) Authorities

Multiple land-use authorities contribute to the warehouses in the Central Valley. They include the cities of Stockton, Tracy, Manteca, Ripon, Lathrop, and San Joaquin County.  

## Map and Data Provenance

The map can be navigated using point, click, and drag features or by clicking on the zoom plus and minus buttons on the top left corner of the map. At the top right of the map, the imagery can be switched between a street level **Basemap** and satellite **Imagery**.
